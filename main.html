            <h2>Portfolio</h2>
            <p>My name is Rustam, I started to learn programming in the end of the winter 2023 and every day I'm studying it - programming becomes more and more interesting to me. My first programming language was Python, but as soon as I realized that Python is not needed in my country as much as I expected, I started to learn another and interesting for me part of programming  - it was web development. I learned HTML, than I spent a lot of time to understand and learn CSS and now I almost finished to learn JS. This is my first website I'm using skills of those three technologies, and I hope it will show my level as front-end developer</p>

                <span>My favourite project - web page for club of meat&bear lovers!</span>

                    </figure>
                </div>
                <P>This website is made for imagine club of people who love meat and bear and funny companies. I used HTML and CSS here, and a lot of my imagination to make this website such attractive</P>
            </div>
            <div id = "second project">
                <span>My another project where I was studying responsive design - website for photographers, "Fotomatic"</span>
                <figure>
                    <img src = "res/Fotomatic1.png" alt = "Fotomatic website on a big screens">
                    <img src = "res/Fotomatic2.png" alt = "Fotomatic website on a small screens">
                    <figcaption>Photos of Fotomatic website on two different screens</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>It took a lot of time for me to ensure that website is accesible for all common types of screen. I was using CSS only to repair broken design of the website, and I brave that I did it almost as good as it was in solution code</p>

                <span>The third one in this collection is one of my first but one of the coolest viewed website - "Fozzy tea" </span>
