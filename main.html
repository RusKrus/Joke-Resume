My first programming language was Python, but as soon as I realized that Python is not needed in my country as much as I expected, I started to learn another and interesting for me part of programming  - it was web development. I learned HTML, than I spent a lot of time to understand and learn CSS and now I almost finished to learn JS. This is my first website I'm using skills of those three technologies, and I hope it will show my level as front-end developer</p>
